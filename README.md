# GuessTheFlag
An app made with SwiftUI to guess the flag of the country. 100daysofSwiftUI

The name of the Country is at the top and 3 flags that are buttons, one of them is the correct flag. If the correct flag is clicked, the flag tapped spins around and an alert pops up saying "Correct" and new score. The score count at the bottom of the page adds one. If the wrong flag is chosen, an alert badge pops up saying "Wrong" and no new score is added. Each game has 8 questions per game. At the end of 8 Questions an alert pops up for "Game Over" with the final score out of 8 listed, and a button to reset the game. Once the "Reset" button is clicked, the score goes back to 0 and the game question count also returns to 0.
